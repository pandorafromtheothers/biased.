This was my first Javascript project I wanted to make, so I made it.
The code is mostly a mess, with every single thing in global and all, but hey, everyone starts somewhere, and it works! That's enough for a first time.

The goal with the design was to look good on phones and nothing else. That's why it looks like that, thank you!
