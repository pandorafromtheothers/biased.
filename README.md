This was my first Javascript project I wanted to make, so I made it.
The code is mostly a mess, with every single thing in global and all, but hey, everyone starts somewhere, and it works! That's enough for me.

The goal with the design was to look good on phones and nothing else. That's why it looks like that, thank you!
